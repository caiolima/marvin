========================================================
HISTORY
========================================================
 We named project like Marvin because I found in many places
 talking that OS development is very sadness, hardness,
 terrible task in Computer Science hehe. 
 However, this can be the most fun and interactive job.
 So Marvin is a reference of sadness robot in Book's Series
 the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy writed by Douglas Adams.
